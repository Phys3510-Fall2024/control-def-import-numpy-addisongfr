    "- The identity operation does not change any aspect of the object, only restating the original properties of the object- this could be considered redundant, but it serves as a helpful baseline for the rest of the symmetry table. In this symmetry table, the inversion operation and the mirroring across the z-axis operation happen to have the same outcome across the four objects, so together, they are redundant in this case- however, this may not the case for objects created from different coordinates. Mirroring across the y-axis and rotating 180 degrees about the x-axis both have unique symmetry outcomes in this table.\n",

From the symmetry table above, there is no $Q_i * Q_j$ term that is even under all operations- however, $Q_2 * Q_3 * Q_4$ is possible! $Q_2 * Q_3$ (pseudoscalar * polar vector) creates a row of symmetry identities of (1, 1, 1, -1, -1). Multiplied by $Q_4$ (axial vector) results in a row of (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). The energy is even under all of these symmetries, so these objects can be coupled together- and of course, this $Q_2 * Q_3 * Q_4$ system can be multiplied by $Q_1$ (scalar) and maintain its even symmetry, so this system is possible as well."
